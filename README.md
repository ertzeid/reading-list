# reading-list
Here are some things I've found useful, meaningful, or otherwise worth reading.

## Managing humans
### Blogs
 * [_Rands in Repose_](https://randsinrepose.com/) - I heaven't read a Michael Lopp piece or watched one of his talks and not learned a ton
 * [_Ask a Manager_](https://www.askamanager.org/) - Advice column covering a ton of management topics. Includes managing sideways and upward, as it's not only managers asking for advice. For a fun reminder that your situation could always be worse, check out the annual "Most popular posts of..." posts ([Here's 2019's](https://www.askamanager.org/2019/12/most-popular-posts-of-2019-2.html))
### Articles/Blog posts
 * [The Update, The Vent, and the Disaster](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/) - 1:1 advice from _Rands in Repose_
 * [The New Manager Death Spiral](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-new-manager-death-spiral/) Also from _Rands_
 * [18F's — now TTS's — One-to-ones guide](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/one-on-ones/)
 * [The Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) about thinking about going into management
 * [Engineering Management: The Pendulum or the Ladder](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/) about how to think about your management career once you've decided to pursue one

Note: the two Rands posts have also been turned into excellent conference talks — see Calibrate conference in the next section.
### Conference talks/archives
 * [Calibrate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4Hx13f6KQZXj9rHtr5pRg) - I went to the 2017 Calibrate conference and learned a ton. The final Calibrate happened in fall of 2019, but their archives are all easy to find on the linked YouTube channel.
